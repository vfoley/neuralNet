## Neural Net

To use this neural net, clone the repository to your local machine and run the "neuralNet.py"
file in python3. It currently normalizes weather and class data for processing and runs the data 
through one set of weights to a hidden layer of nodes. It prints out the weighted value for the weather data with 
BIAS_VALUE of 1. I still need to implement the activation formula for the node. I can do that in the same function 
that I am weighting in. I then can pass the values to the next layer of nodes or to the final 
output function. I also need to implement a way to set the number of layers to make and initialize.

Still need to make a training and tracking module to limit data for training and then test with remaining data. 

All files necessary are in the repository, and merged to this point to the master branch. There is 
also a development branch that I am making changes on.
